A program to control a Lynxmotion robot arm in python.

Main Features:
- Flexible design allows prgram to operate on robot using SM322 Serial board on computer, or to be loaded directly onto a Rasberr Pi Pico W to control the arm.
- Full controller support for XBox One controller or later. (Other controllers can be added, but this will have to be implemented by the user)
- Flexible robot config using YAML files.
- full FK and IK (to be implemented before end of project).
- Teach mode, allowing robot to perform repeated actions once taught by user.
- Communication between computer and Rasberry Pi Pico.
  
Completed as part of UWE 3rd year GDIP project.
